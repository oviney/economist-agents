AGENT DESIGN PATTERNS (from CrewAI):\n   - Role/Goal/Backstory definition best practices\n   - Tool selection and integration patterns\n   - Memory and context management strategies\n   - Reasoning and planning capabilities\n   - Code execution modes (safe/unsafe)\n   - Multi-modal agent configurations\n\n2. ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS:\n   - Sequential vs Hierarchical vs Graph-based flows\n   - Task delegation and handoff strategies\n   - State management in complex workflows\n   - Human-in-the-loop integration points\n   - Error handling and retry strategies\n\n3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:\n   - Multi-agent communication patterns\n   - Crew composition and team structures\n   - Agent specialization vs generalization trade-offs\n   - Performance optimization (context windows, rate limits, caching)\n   - Testing strategies for agent systems\n\n4. TECHNICAL DECISION EVALUATION:\n   - LLM selection criteria (GPT-4 vs GPT-4o-mini vs Claude)\n   - When to use function calling vs tools\n   - Safe vs unsafe code execution trade-offs\n   - Memory/knowledge source strategies\n   - Framework integration patterns (LangGraph, AutoGen)\n\n5. QUALITY VALIDATION:\n   - Agent configuration review checklist\n   - System architecture compliance validation\n   - Performance metrics and monitoring\n   - Security review for tool integrations\n   - Documentation completeness checks\n\nREFERENCE EXAMPLES (Don't Reinvent):\n- CrewAI docs: Agent attributes, flows, best practices\n- AutoGen: AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, GroupChat patterns\n- crewAI-examples: Marketing strategy, content creator flow, lead scoring\n- Microsoft patterns: Orchestrator agents, specialized workers\n\nIMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:\n1. Create .github/agents/architect.agent.md specification\n2. Define tool set: CrewAI docs access, pattern library, ADR templates\n3. Configure with reasoning=true for strategic planning\n4. Enable knowledge_sources for framework documentation\n5. Test with real system designs from Sprint 9-10 roadmap",
